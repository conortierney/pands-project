# Programming and Scripting Project 2023

### Author: Conor Tierney

This is the repository for the final project of the Programming and Scripting module in the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics 
at ATU. The projects focus is on investigating the well-known Fisherâ€™s Iris data set. The dataset contains information about different types of Iris flowers.


## Steps taken for project 
my approach to the task , breaking ot down into smaller bits to code - review output and add code .
1. Import data set from = .csv file
2.

# Fisher's Iris Dataset history
The Fisher's Iris dataset is a widely used dataset in data analysis and statistics. It contains measurements of the various physical features of 3 types of Iris flowers, namely Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. It consistes of 50 records for each of the 3 species.
The dataset was created by Ronald Fisher in 1936 to show how discriminant analysis can tell different types of plants apart. It's a well-known dataset for exploratory data analysis, classification, clustering, and visualization purposes [1] [2].

refe here: Iris dataset contains five columns such as Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal Width and Species Type. 
Iris is a flowering plant, the researchers have measured various features of the different iris flowers and recorded digitally. [ geeks].

## Iris dataset .csv file 
This repository contains a file called IrisDataset.csv that was used in this analysis(link).

The dataset comprises 150 records, and each species has 50 samples.

The dataset columns are : Id,SepalLengthCm,SepalWidthCm,PetalLengthCm,PetalWidthCm and Species.
