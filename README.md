# Programming and Scripting Project 2023

### Author: Conor Tierney

This is the repository for the final project of the Programming and Scripting module in the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics 
at ATU. The projects focus is on investigating the well-known Fisherâ€™s Iris data set. The dataset contains information about different types of Iris flowers.


## Steps taken for project 
1. Import data set from = .csv file
2. 


## Table of Contents

# Fisher's Iris Dataset history
The Fisher's Iris dataset is a widely used dataset in data analysis and statistics. It contains measurements of the various physical features of 3 types of iris flowers, namely Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. It consistes of 50 records for r=each of the 3 species.
The dataset was created by Ronald Fisher in 1936 to show how discriminant analysis can tell different types of plants apart. It's a well-known dataset for exploratory data analysis, classification, clustering, and visualization purposes [1] [2].
