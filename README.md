# Programming and Scripting Project 2023

### Author: Conor Tierney

This is the repository for the final project of the Programming and Scripting module in the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics 
at ATU. The projects focus is on investigating the well-known Fisherâ€™s Iris data set. The dataset contains information about different types of Iris flowers.

## Steps taken for pands -project completion.
my approach to the task , breaking ot down into smaller parts to code - review output and add code .
1. Import the libraries needed to run the code.
2. Import data set from = .csv file
3. read in data frame; for summary txt file , columns , variables  - explors ummary re mean , kmin std of each variable
4. Generate png files  - Histograms 
5. Gnerate scatterplots - png files 



# Fisher's Iris Dataset history
The Fisher's Iris dataset is a widely used dataset in data analysis and statistics. It contains measurements of the various physical features of 3 types of Iris flowers, namely Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. It consistes of 50 records for each of the 3 species.
The dataset was created by Ronald Fisher in 1936 to show how discriminant analysis can tell different types of plants apart. It's a well-known dataset for exploratory data analysis, classification, clustering, and visualization purposes [1] [2].

refe here: Iris dataset contains five columns such as Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal Width and Species Type. 
Iris is a flowering plant, the researchers have measured various features of the different iris flowers and recorded digitally. [ geeks].

## Iris dataset .csv file 
the data set used (1. original data set)  in this repository contains a file called IrisDataset.csv [link] that was used in this analysis.

The dataset comprises 150 records, and each species has 50 samples.isert screenshot of output

The dataset columns are : Id,SepalLengthCm,SepalWidthCm,PetalLengthCm,PetalWidthCm and Species.

"Using pandas, tabular data can be imported as a DataFrame object. A pandas DataFrame represents a rectangular table of data containing an ordered collection of columns and each column can have a different value type. The Iris data set contains four numerical columns for the petal and sepal measurements and one categorical column for the class or type of iris.

The pandas read_csvfunction loads delimited data from a file, URL or file-like object using the comma as the default delimiter and creates a DataFrame object. When a pandas DataFrame object is created, it has many attributes and methods available that can be used on that object."

The raw csv file: consisting of the 4 measurement attributes (sepal length in cm, sepal width in cm, petal length in cm, petal width in cm) and the three classes (Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor and Iris Virginica). ref angela1c.com
